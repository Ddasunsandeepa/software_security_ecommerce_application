# Secure Food Ordering System
A secure e-commerce platform for food ordering, designed using the MERN stack. This application ensures robust functionality with a strong emphasis on security for three distinct user roles:

Buyers - Browse food items, manage carts, and complete secure payments.
Admins - Manage food inventory, user accounts, and oversee platform security.
Security Engineers - Implement and monitor encryption, multi-factor authentication, and other advanced security measures.
